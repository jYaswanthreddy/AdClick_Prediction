## Internship Project

This repository contains the code and data for the **Ad Click Prediction for AdWave Media** project, completed as part of an internship. The goal of this project is to analyze advertising data and build predictive models to determine the likelihood of users clicking on ads.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** `Ad Click Prediction for AdWave Media.csv`
- **Notebook:** `Copy_of_Ad_Click_Prediction_for_AdWave_Media.ipynb`
- **Visualizations:** See the `images/` folder for data insights and model performance.
