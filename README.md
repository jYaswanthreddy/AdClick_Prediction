![Project Banner](images/Clickthrough%20rate%20by%20campaign%20type.png)

## Overview
This project analyzes advertising data and builds predictive models to determine the likelihood of users clicking on ads. It was completed as part of an internship and demonstrates the full data science workflow: data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Contents
- **Dataset:** `Ad Click Prediction for AdWave Media.csv`
- **Notebook:** `Copy_of_Ad_Click_Prediction_for_AdWave_Media.ipynb`
- **Visualizations:** See the `images/` folder for data insights and model performance plots.

## Key Visualizations
- **Average Time on Site vs Clicked**
